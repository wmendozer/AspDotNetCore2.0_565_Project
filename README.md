  BELOW is a detailed description of hurdles I faced when attempting
    this project. Thank you for reading.
***************************************************************************

This project was pretty difficult to accomplish. Due to commitments like Senior Design
  events and wrapping up that major project, I only started looking at what is needed
  for this project about two weeks before the due date.

Perhaps the biggest hurdle in learning ASP.NET Core 2.0 is the fact stated in class that
  the textbook required by the professor is now outdated. This is a result of an unfortunate
  (for us students) update that made learning about creating web apps very difficult, as it
  is significantly different from the 1.0 iterations.
 
The provided tutorials created by Microsoft are helpful, but probably most helpful to someone
  that already has lots of previous knowledge when it comes to creating web applications.
  For me, however, there are so many technical terms that I have no knowledge about that 
  made it pretty much impossible for me to know what exactly is going on. I think
  what would've helped the most is a sort of "primer" in regards to how ASP.NET Core works
  in simpler, non-technical terms.
 
From my understanding, from reading through a good portion of the Microsoft tutorials,
  you can create a class in C# code that will basically generate SQL databases for you in
  the background. Web apps can work off of these databases in terms of editng, updating,
  and doing all sorts of things with information, which can be saved in a repo and modified
  to the developer's liking. Other than that, there are so many functions doing things that
  I'm not really sure about.
  
As seen in the PDF showing my brainstorming process for my website, I would have liked to create
  a simple website based around teaching bowling basics and offering a discussion board to further
  each other's skills in an online community. I got this idea from my love for bowling, and desire
  to teach others how to get better than the average bowler in terms of technique and theory.
  The website would feature a whole list of articles that I can add to, catering to different skill
  levels. Admins can create articles, along with editing and deleting them. Admins also have full
  editing power when it comes to the forums. For users, on the other hand, they cannot post articles;
  they can only read them, and possibly comment on them. In terms of forum functionality for users, they
  can edit and delete their own posts, not others'. Admins have the power to delete other users' posts
  if they are vulgar or spam.
 
 Another problem I had when trying to complete this project is just doing the tutorial itself.
  The Microsoft tutorial recommended that I start with their step-by-step Razor Pages guide, so 
  I attempted to do that. I started the "Movies" example one day, then didn't get around to returning
  to the example until a week later. Since I wanted a refresher of sorts, I decided to start the example
  again from scratch. I got an error saying that I already have an instance of the Movie class in my solution,
  so I wasn't able to continue through the tutorial at that point. I wanted to work with the example
  and change things around to cater to the bowling app I wanted to create, but I couldn't even get through
  the tutorial. It was made all the more frustrating to know that I don't truly know what's going on in terms
  of the functions that make the web page possible.
  
If we had more time to work on this website, I would love to go through a Udemy course (at a sale price)
  to learn the fundamentals instead of through the Microsoft tutorial. It was too jargon-heavy for
  my taste and I ended up not learning too much, aside from the notion that there is a lot of work
  that goes into creating these web apps for publishing purposes.
